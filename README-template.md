## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project was my first application of HTML and CSS without using a tutorial. I learned what I need to focus on, mainly being repsonsive web design. And I also learned that I need to dive deeper into CSS






### Continued development

I need to work on CSS as I move forward. I had a little bit of trouble moving elements around the page so going forward in my studies that will be my focus


### Useful resources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ - MDN was a saving grace and provided me with a ton of helpful information
